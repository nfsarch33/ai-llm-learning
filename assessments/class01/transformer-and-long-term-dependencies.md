# Transformers and Long-term Dependencies
## Transformers
- Novel architecture in NLP that handles sequence-to-sequence tasks1
- Relies on the attention mechanism2
- Notable for requiring less training time compared to LSTM2
- Parallelized processing of input sequence2

## Attention Mechanism
- Core component of Transformers2
- Contextualizes each token with other input tokens in parallel2
- Proposed earlier in 2014 for machine translation2

## Resolving Long-term Dependencies
- Transformers handle long-range dependencies with ease1
- Unlike RNNs, Transformers do not require the sequence to be processed in order2
- This allows the model to pay "attention" to any part of the sequence at any point, resolving the long-term dependency issue2

## Self-Attention
- Key component in handling long-term dependencies1
- Allows the model to weigh the importance of tokens within the sequence1
- Each token gets a score (attention score) that determines how much focus should be placed on that token1

## Applications
- Training large language models on large datasets2
- Used in natural language processing, computer vision, and other areas2
- Time series forecasting3

## Limitations and Challenges
- Despite its advantages, Transformers can still struggle with extremely long sequences4
- There is ongoing research to improve Transformers' handling of long sequences5

## Additional Notes
- The Transformer model was introduced in 20172
- It has been adopted for training large language models like GPT-36

Please note that this mindmap is a simplified representation of the topic. The actual process involves complex mathematical operations and algorithms. For a more in-depth understanding, I recommend studying the original research papers and related literature.

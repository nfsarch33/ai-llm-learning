# AI LLM: Differences between GPT and BERT
## GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)
- Developed by OpenAI[^1^]
- Uses a transformer-based architecture[^6^]
- Optimized for conversational interfaces[^11^]
- Models are conversation-in and message-out[^11^]
- Can generate human-like text[^10^]
- Can be used for brainstorming ideas[^2^]
- Used in ChatGPT[^3^]
- Commands for ChatGPT can be formulated as concrete prompts[^5^]
- OpenAI also developed GPT-3 and GPT-4[^9^]
- GPT-3 and GPT-4 models are larger and more resource-intensive[^9^]
- Open-source alternatives to GPT-3 and GPT-4 are available[^9^]

## BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- Developed by Google[^9^]
- Uses a transformer-based architecture[^6^]
- Can understand the context of a word based on its surroundings[^6^]
- Can be used for tasks like text generation, text classification[^12^]
- Open-source alternative to GPT[^9^]

## Connectivity between each scope/domain/service
- Both GPT and BERT are large language models (LLMs) used in natural language processing (NLP)[^4^][^12^]
- Both models are based on transformer architectures[^6^]
- Both models can be used in various AI applications, including ChatGPT for GPT[^3^] and text generation and classification tasks for BERT[^12^]
- Both models have open-source alternatives[^9^]

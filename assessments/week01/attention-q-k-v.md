# AI Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs are artificial intelligence models designed to process, analyze, and generate natural language1. They are trained on large datasets, which contain hundreds of millions to billions of words2.

## Key Points
LLMs are revolutionizing how we process language1
They are based on deep learning algorithms that analyze large volumes of text1
LLMs can learn to process, generate, and understand language at a human-like level1
Examples of popular LLMs include Google’s BERT and OpenAI’s GPT1

# Attention Mechanism
In artificial neural networks, attention is a technique that enhances some parts of the input data while diminishing other parts3.

## Key Points
- Attention-like mechanisms were introduced in the 1990s3
- The flexibility of these models comes from the introduction of "soft" weights that can change during runtime3

# "Q", "K", and "V" in Attention Model
The attention mechanism in transformer models, which are often used in LLMs, involves three key components: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V)4.

### Query (Q)
- Represents the current word being focused on
- Used to calculate the attention scores

### Key (K)
- Represents all the words in the input sequence
- Used in conjunction with Q to calculate the attention scores

### Value (V)
- Also represents all the words in the input sequence
- Used to create the final output of the attention layer, which is a weighted sum of the V vectors, where the weights are the attention scores

### Applications of LLMs
- Automate processes5
- Save time and money5
- Drive personalization5
- Increase accuracy in tasks5
- Challenges of LLMs
- LLMs don't "understand" the meaning of text like a human does6
- They understand a text through statistical interpretation by learning from vast amounts of data6
